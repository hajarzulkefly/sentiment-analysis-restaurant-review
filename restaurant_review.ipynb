            "Dear family & friends, my husband & I patronised Delicious on his birthday. I ordered baked beans, clearly marked as vegetarian on the menu. Halfway through the meal he discovered meat in the baked beans. On questioning the manager, we found out that the baked beans was prepared with beef stock & beef bacon. When we asked who the chef was, we were told that these items were prepared in the main kitchen and were sent out to all their restaurants in Klang Valley. We were shocked & deeply disappointed as this is a favourite restaurant & we have been there in good faith. We wrote an official complaint. It has been a week & we haven't heard from them. Please inform all your Hindus, Buddhists,vegetarians & people who don't consume beef of this & ask them not to patronise this chain of restaurants. We have escalated this to the consumer association.

Also their shrimps same as their crab was to smelly and bad taste after grilling.

            "Terrible customer service at your Aeon kinta city mall, Ipoh outlet!!!! I am a regular Starbucks customer, so wanted to give coffee bean a try and so went to the counter asking that girl to recommend me what is nice to drink. Then she suggested some newly launch flavor which I'm not convinced. So I politely asked for another. She then suggested again. Then again I turned it down. She then responded rudely to me by yelling out loud that if I don't trust her, what for to ask for her suggestion at first. Then she laugh loudly at me just like I am begging her for that drink! Not only her, the other crew there were laughing out loud as well! I then asked her for her name card but she just ignored me. What type of customer service is this? Where is our consumer right?! I really hope to get a proper explanation as well as apologize from that particular coffee bean outlet! This is totally a disgrace to Coffee Bean Malaysia!!! \n",

I went to that branch today (24-1-2014) and the crew girl at the counter scolded us and then laugh at us loud in front of all the crews and other customers simply because we took too long time to think what to drink and wasted the girl too much of saliva and energy to serve us! What type of customer service is this? This made me feel like being humiliated and insulted!!
